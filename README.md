# Deep-Learning based Brain Tumor Detection
## Brain MRI images are our Input Images for the classification Task.
## Transer Learning Techniques are applied for the trained models VGG16, ResNet 50, Inception V3.
## Web page was developed to enable experts to upload an MRI image of a patient, thereby facilitating the detection of the presence or absence of a brain tumor, accompanied by the corresponding probability assessment.
